## IMGD4000: "Write a tutorial" assignment

Part of the point of getting you all to work together in the same place is to practice communal learning- to build a body of knowledge together, such that everyone can uplift each other. 
Building our body of tutorials helps you and other IMGD students!

Is there something you wish you'd learned sooner? An explanation of a subsystem that would've proved useful? Write a detailed tutorial explaining a reasonably complex (see below examples) topic in UE5. 

Here are two good examples of tutorials:
- [Tutorial 3](https://github.com/LenaDias/imgd4000-2025/blob/master/day_3_blueprints.md)
- Ellie Kim's [tutorial on UE5 UI with C++ and Blueprints](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x0AnOffqhzFQHURyjzWtD6sJf1BgIDsgDt4FfpliX04/edit?usp=sharing)

Note how these two tutorials not only demonstrate the "how" of the steps being taken (often supporting it with step-by-step images of the UI), but also explain the "why" of why we are taking taking those steps.
There is also an effort to handle potential errors the user might encounter. Try to empathize with your reader and imagine the state of mind they approach each step with; what information would they not know as a newbie that you can share?

## Requirements
1. Write a tutorial about a topic in Unreal Engine 5, thoroughly explaining the steps you take along the way.
2. Provide your tutorial as a .docx file by submitting to "Additional (individual) tech assignments" on Canvas. 

## Grading
25% : Sufficiently complex topic 
25% : Thorough explanation of steps taken in tutorial. Address the "why" of each step as well as the "how"
25% : Tutorial is well-organized and easily understood. 
25% : Tutorial supports itself with images, links, etc. that would be useful
